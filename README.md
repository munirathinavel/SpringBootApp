# SpringBootApp

I've created Spring Boot Application with Spring with Java Annotation. For Storing objects I'm using HashMap of User Id & User Objects.


This application comprises of following features,

1. Add New User - New user will be added to Java Collection storage
2. Update Existing User - Existing user will be updated with given information. Throws error if any user not found
3. Delete User   - Delete the user from Collection Store. Throws error if User not found.
